# Slot Machine (Python)

## Project Overview

This project is a simple implementation of a slot machine algorithm, designed as a code-along tutorial from YouTube. The primary goal is to practice Python syntax and enhance your understanding of basic programming concepts through hands-on coding.

## Features

* A basic slot machine game simulation.
* Randomly generated outcomes for each spin.
* User-friendly interface to interact with the game.
